#### Group Members

#### Communication Protocols
- As a team of two, our means of communication is through Slack.

## Project Overview
**Objective**
- Given the current state of the nation, we hope to answer the question whether or not patients that enter hospitals can get pneumonia based on: when they entered the hospital, when they started feeling their symptoms, age, sex, and a few other variables.
- We plan to use a supervised machine learning model to determine the likelihood of patients catching pneumonia.
